## Smart Farming Powered By AI 
An interactive web-based app that predict the best crop to grow based on several parameters of soil and climate. Crop Prediction AI is a modern farming technique that uses the data of soil characteristics and weather conditions and suggests the farmers with the most optimal crop to grow in their farms for maximum yield and profit. This AI will help farmers and other users to take informed decision about their farming strategy. 

## Background
An application has been developed with the purpose to recommend optimum crops to  be cultivated by farmers and others. The data utilized for this application is sourced from 
The data have Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and pH values of soil. Also, it contains the humidity, temperature and rainfall. 

The primary objective behind developing this application is to educate public on precision agriculture and to recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by framers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation. Our target audience of this application are individuals with no knowledge of farming or farmers who are involved in farming in their daily lives. We aimed to help people who don't have knowledge about agriculture but they want toi grow some veggies and fruits in their garden or back/front yard. On the other hand, it is beneficial for farmers as well, who are expert in farming. It helps farmers by providing information such as: In what climate which crop thrive? This bit of information will help farmers to take informed decision and for maximum yeild.

## Technical Notes 
## Data Cleaning Using Pandas 
# Flask Application 
    Python code is used to build a Flask application that serves as a web server for Crop Recommendation AI

> Libraries and Imports 
    Libraries and modules imported, including Flask, Pickle, os, numpy, pandas along with other dependencies 
  
> Flask Routes 
    The Flask application is created with routes defined for different HTML temnplates. These routes handle requests for the main page and prediction page. The corresponding HTML templates are rendered and returned to the client.  

> Model Routes 
> Running the Application 
    The application is run when when the cript is executed directly. The application runs in debug mode, which provides detailed error messages fo0r ndebugging purposes.
